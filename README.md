# Rob√≥tica en la escuela - Robot simulator
The *Robot simulator* is a tool for teaching programing basics by letting the user play and explore with the blocks it provides for the robot's movement.

The simulator uses MelonJS as the gaming library for the robot, Blocky for the blocky styled language, Bootstrap and others.

Latter versions of the robot simulator used a written language using Jison as the language parser. The new way of programming, using Blocky, introduces an easier way to give the robot instructions, eliminating the need to write, that could be hard to some people that haven't had experience with computers before, making the focus in the logics of programming itself.

## Running:
Running a webserver with the code should be sufficient.
